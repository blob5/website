## Hi
I'm still alive. I didn't even think I would ever write on this website but here I am.
I don't think I will write again soon, but I just wanted to update some things on this site and I thought I might as well write a post while I'm at it.

## Switching sides

I'm switching over to cyber security. I've been programming for a couple of years now, and while I still enjoy it, I don't enjoy the development process as much as I thought I would. I find myself more interested in the security aspects of software and networks, and I've been exploring that side of things for some time now with [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). 

For now I'm learning a bunch about the basics of cyber security, a few goals I have are getting a Security+ certification and learn more about malware analysis. I've been learning a bunch about red teaming but I've recently tried out a couple of blue team rooms on TryHackMe and I really enjoyed them too.
We'll see where this takes me, but I'm happy to find something that I enjoy so much.
